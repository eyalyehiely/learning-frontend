## Introduction

This project is designed to help students and mentors conduct remote coding sessions. 
by writing and changing the code in real-time. 
The application consists of two main pages:
- The Lobby page.
- The Code Block page.

## Features

### Lobby Page

- The Lobby page displays a list of code blocks.
- Users can choose a code block, which will navigate them to the Code Block page.

### Code Block Page

- The first user to open the Code Block page is considered the mentor, other subsequent users are students.
- The mentor sees the code block in read-only mode.
- Students can edit the code block, changes are displayed in real-time using WebSockets.


### Check Code - Bonus Feature

- Each code block can have a “solution” field. If the student's code matches the solution, a big smiley face is displayed on the screen.

## Tech 

### Frontend

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **react-bootstrap**: 
- **@monaco-editor/react**: 
- **@mui/material**: 




- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication between the mentor and student.

### Backend

- **Django**: For the backend server and handling API requests.
- **Django Channels**: For WebSocket support to enable real-time updates.
- **Django Rest Framework**: For building RESTful APIs.

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: For storing code blocks and user data.
- **Redis**:

### Deployment

- **Railway**:

## Quick Start
Follow these steps to set up and run the application using Docker:

## Configure Environment Variables
1.Inspect the settings.py file in each service to identify required environment variables.

2.Create a .env file for each service, supplying the necessary variables. It's crucial to ensure that these variables are correctly set before proceeding.



## Run Containers
Start each service with the following command:
```
docker pull eyalyehiely/backend:latest
(port8000)
```

```
docker pull eyalyehiely/frontend:latest
(port 3000)
```


## Local Development without Docker

1. Clone the backend repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/eyalyehiely/learning-backend/
    cd learning/backend
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    on macOS:
    python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

    on Windows:
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the database (make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running):
    ```bash
    on macOS:
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate
    on Windows:
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    daphne -p 8000 backend.asgi:application

6. Run the redis server:
    ```
    redis-server
    ```
    


### Frontend

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/eyalyehiely/learning-frontend/
    cd learning/backend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
